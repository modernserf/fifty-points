# "fifty points at random"

## TODO
- dark mode vs light mode
- toggle 3D controls
- spooky 3D move
- walk through source code
- more on "who is the artist" & auteur theory
- more on algorithm + randomness as creativity
- audience participation version



"fifty points at random"
========================
When does process become art? When do tools become collaborators? And why does DeepDream keep putting dog faces on everything? Learn about procedural art (both analog and digital) and the relationship between computation and creativity.

- imperfections make the art
- tools as colaborators
- e.g. deep dream algo
- Sol LeWitt wall drawings / Dia: Beacon

“On a wall surface, any
continuous stretch of wall,
using a hard pencil, place
fifty points at random.
The points should be evenly
distributed over the area
of the wall. All of the
points should be connected
by straight lines.”

Last spring, my partner and I took a train upstate to Beacon for the weekend. We visited a museum called Dia:Beacon that specializes in large installations.

Hello everyone in the front row! Don't tell anyone but you get some ~bonus content~

Its difficult to convey this experience with photographs. Its one thing to look at a Richard Serra sculpture, but its another thing altogether to confront its enormity in person and walk around inside of it.
---
I don't believe in the supernatural but our AirBnB had an intense horror movie vibe to it.

Imagine turning a corner in their shadowy basement and encountering this sculpture by Louise Bourgeois.
---
We arrived at 1:30 PM and the owner told us that she had just put her child to bed, which seemed a little odd.

Not everything was this "in your face". Some of it was subtle, almost to the point of parody. [ryman]

Our room was decorated with taxidermy, saw blades, and mannequin limbs, which the owner said she bought from Mia Farrow.

procedural art [weiner]

There was also a stack of unlabelled casette tapes in the room, which I can only _assume_ was recordings of demonic summoning incantations.

- Sol LeWitt was an American artist who worked in the mid to late 20th century
- extreme minimalist art
- structures and wall drawings
---
We heard low rumblings at night, but never saw her child.

- lewitt's work is popular with a lot of programmers
- partly i admire the laziness of describing a sculpture in a few sentences and leaving the actual construction as an implementaiton detail

Celebration of ambiguity
Emergent behavior -- pathological cases in work, also artificial life
Procedural ambiguity -- bugs and underspecifications in work, interesting variations in art

Ambiguity
- Size/proportions of wall (responsive design)
- how are lines connected
- different flavors of randomness
- what if it's around a corner?

Wall drawings are a collaborative/conversational process between the author and the implementors

Parallels with play (script vs performance)

Wall drawings are like software, but mostly like very simple games/restricted creative tools, because it embraces unexpected use and interpretation


Tools as collaborators
Processes as memes
LeWitt, like tupac, continues to produce art a decade after his death

I'm gonna tell you a ghost story about an artist that's producing work from beyond the grave

There is nothing fundamentally different between rendering wall drawing 118 with canvas and googles deepdream

Who is the artist? Me, leWitt, or the algorithm itself?

"The idea becomes a machine that makes the art"

"The ideas need not be complex. Most ideas that are successful are ludicrously simple. Successful ideas generally have the appearance of simplicity because they seem inevitable."

---

procedures as open source art

instructions are widely available
anyone can make an "authentic" sol lewitt
"Anyone who understands the work of art owns it. We all own the Mona Lisa."

---

design for impermanence
wall drawings are ephemeral

 In a sense, every new installation is a collaboration between a space, a draftsman, a wall, and LeWitt himself, composing posthumously. There is something wonderful and comforting about the fact that these works can’t be ruined, they can be created and destroyed a million times over, but they will not be lost. They exist as ideas.
